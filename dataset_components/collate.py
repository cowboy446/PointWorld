def custom_collate_fn(batch, args):
    """
    Collate function that pads the variable number of points across samples
    to the maximum found in the batch. Also creates new keys 'scene_exists' and
    'robot_exists' which are boolean masks indicating real (True) vs. padded (False) points.

    Args:
        batch: List of samples, where each sample is a dict of torch.Tensors
        args: Arguments object

    Assumes each item in `batch` is a dict of torch.Tensors with shapes:
        - scene_flows: (T, N_scene, D_scene)
        - robot_flows: (T, N_robot, D_robot)
        - scene_features: (T, N_scene, F_scene), etc.

    Returns:
        collated (dict of torch.Tensor):
            Keys will include all from the individual samples plus:
              - 'scene_exists': (B, T, max_N_scene)
              - 'robot_exists': (B, T, max_N_robot)

            Fields that don't have that shape are just stacked along the batch dimension.
